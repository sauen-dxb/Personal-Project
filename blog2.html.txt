        <h2>Exploring the Link Between Suffering and Creativity</h2>
        <p>
            The stereotype of the "tortured artist" suggests that great creativity is born from suffering. This belief has been perpetuated throughout history, with artists and writers often depicted as individuals who channel their emotional pain into their work. While there is some truth to the connection between emotional intensity and artistic expression, this stereotype can be damaging.

        <h3>Consequences of the Stereotype</h3>
        <p>
            By romanticizing the idea that suffering is necessary for creativity, media may unintentionally discourage individuals from seeking help for their mental health. Instead, suffering is seen as a badge of honor, or a sign of artistic depth, rather than a condition that warrants support and treatment.
