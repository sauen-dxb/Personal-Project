        <h2>Reflecting on the Allure of Tragic Beauty</h2>
        <p>
            Many media portrayals of mental illness carry an aesthetic appeal, romanticizing emotional pain as something inherently linked to creativity or depth. This trend is evident across various forms of art, from films to music, where sadness is not merely represented but glorified.

        <h3>The Impact on Young Audiences</h3>
        <p>
            For young viewers, the aestheticization of suffering can be particularly harmful, shaping their perceptions of mental health. When media frames suffering as tragically beautiful, it may discourage individuals from seeking help, instead perpetuating the idea that sadness is a necessary component of an artistic life.
