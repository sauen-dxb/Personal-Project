        <h2>Exploring Horror, Trauma, and the Aesthetic of Madness</h2>
        <p>
            "American Horror Story: Asylum" combines supernatural horror with psychological and physical suffering, depicting a 1960s mental institution where patients experience inhumane treatment. The portrayal of madness as both horrific and intriguing adds a dramatic layer to the narrative, but it also risks romanticizing suffering by framing it as a spectacle.
        </p>
        <h3>Romanticization of Suffering</h3>
        <p>
            The show's visual style, with its gothic and oppressive atmosphere, creates an aesthetic around the suffering of the characters. This approach can evoke both fear and fascination, potentially leading audiences to view mental illness as a source of dark beauty.
        </p>
        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
        <p>
            While the show’s horror-driven portrayal draws attention to historical issues in mental health care, it does not always balance this with a nuanced discussion of recovery or empathy, potentially perpetuating negative stereotypes about mental illness.
