        <h2>Analyzing the Romanticization of Mental Illness</h2>
        <p>
            "Girl Interrupted" (1999) depicts the struggles of young women in a psychiatric hospital, exploring themes of trauma, self-harm, and recovery. While the film sheds light on the realities of mental illness, it sometimes romanticizes these struggles, particularly through the character of Lisa, whose rebellious nature is glamorized. This case study will delve into the ethical considerations surrounding the portrayal of mental illness and its impact on audiences.

        <h3>Romanticization of Suffering</h3>
        <p>
            Lisa’s chaotic personality and unfiltered behavior are presented in a way that draws the audience’s attention, potentially framing suffering as something intriguing or desirable. The film's portrayal of Susanna’s depression through introspective narration adds a layer of romanticism to her mental health crisis, which can be problematic in shaping viewers' perceptions.
        </p>
        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
        <p>
            Although the film does raise awareness about mental health, it risks glorifying these conditions by portraying intense emotional experiences as sources of allure rather than conditions requiring serious treatment.
